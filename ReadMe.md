## Course Description:
Concepts and techniques for systems engineering, requirements analysis, design, implementation and testing of large scale computer systems. Principles of software engineering for production of reliable, maintainable and portable software products. Emphasis on functional analysis and structured design techniques. Topics include unit, integration and systems testing, configuration management, and software quality assurance practices. Participation in group activities involving analysis, design and implementation of a software intensive system. Introduction to Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE).

## Student Learning Outcomes
By the successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
- Create effective documentation for computer code.
- Organize and express ideas clearly and convincingly in oral and written forms.
- Construct project plans.
- Identify project life cycle components.
- Create a design document.
- Perform a requirements analysis.
- Create project review presentations.

## Learning Environment:
Each week will be a blend of lecture and lab.  The first meeting of the day is a lecture and will cover new material.  The second meeting period of the day will be devoted to the group term project.  It is expected that students attend all class sessions and review the appropriate material prior to class.

## Grading:
The course grade will be determined by a weighted average of quizzes, exams, and project.

### Quizzes – 15%
- It is expected that you will prepare for each lecture by reviewing the reading assignments. Questions will be drawn from reading assignments and lecture material.

### Exams – 35%

- Midterm - 15%, Date: March 13, 2019 11:00 AM to 11:50 AM
- Final – 20%, Date: May 17, 2019 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM

### Project – 50%

- To emulate software development in a professional environment the largest percentage of your grade will come from a semester long group project. Details of the project will be provided in the first lab session.
- Final Project Demo – Date: May 15, 2019 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM

Please ask about my expectations regarding academic dishonesty in this course if they are unclear.

**Disability Statement**
- If you are a student with a disability requesting reasonable accommodations in this course, please visit Disability Accommodations and Support Services (DASS) located on the second floor of Arroyo Hall, or call 805-437-3331. All requests for reasonable accommodations require registration with DASS in advance of need:https://www.csuci.edu/dass/students/apply-for-services.htm.
